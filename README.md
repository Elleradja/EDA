Project Title: Analysis of Socioeconomic Indicators and Government Transfers in Brazilian Municipalities

Description: This project analyzes socioeconomic data from Brazilian municipalities, focusing on government transfers, literacy rates, poverty, education levels, and population. Using Python and various data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and statsmodels, the project performs data cleaning, visualization, and regression analysis to understand the impact of government transfers on literacy rates.

Key Tasks:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Renamed columns for clarity and identified missing values. The dataset was checked for representation of all major regions and missing values were filled with the mean.
Descriptive Analysis: Calculated and visualized mean, median, and standard deviation of population data. Explored literacy and poverty rates through bar and scatter plots.
Regression Analysis: Conducted simple and multiple linear regression to analyze the relationship between government transfers and literacy rates and investigated heterogeneous effects based on poverty levels and population size.
Data Transformation: Aggregated data at the state level and reshaped the dataset to facilitate further analysis.
Technologies Used:

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
Data Source: Brazilian municipalities' socioeconomic data
Results: The analysis provided insights into how government transfers correlate with literacy rate improvements, particularly in poorer municipalities. It also highlighted regional disparities and the impact of demographic factors.

Visualizations:

Bar plots for mean literacy rates across different regions
Scatter plots showing the relationship between poverty rates and literacy rates
Regression lines indicating the impact of government transfers
This project provides a comprehensive look at the socioeconomic landscape of Brazil and the role of government transfers in improving educational outcomes.
